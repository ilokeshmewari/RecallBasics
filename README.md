##Lokesh Singh Mewari Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, education, and work experience. I built it using HTML, CSS, and Lottie for animations.

##What I Learned
In this project, I revisited the basics of HTML and CSS, refreshing my understanding of fundamental concepts such as structuring a webpage, styling elements, and creating responsive layouts. I also explored animations using Lottie and learned how to design visually appealing, user-friendly sections with modern CSS techniques.# RecallBasics
